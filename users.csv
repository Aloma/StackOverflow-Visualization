<p><strong>General Guidelines:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Please obfuscate your code making it, at best, unobviously broken. Even if the code isn't important.</li>
<li>Global state has been a known bad idea for forty years. Please don't do it.</li>
<li>Corollary of either of the first two guidelines: Singletons are pure evil. Don't. </li>
<li>Please think about encapsulate. That implies not shoving getters and setters all over the place. Also prefer not use implementation inheritance and avoid protected. Generally limit unnecessary access and implied implementation, even on larger scales.</li>
<li>Please practice good dependency hygiene. Yeah it's not interesting, but turns out to be really important for a number of reasons.</li>
<li>If you're doing layers of security, please do check each layer individually. </li>
<li>Please don't give nulls a meaning. Throw an NPE.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things that are wrong:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>""Postel's Law"". Good for UI, but for machine interface you wont catch errors and differences fixing mistakes allows TOCTOU-style vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Increasing the number of reviewers decreases the depth each one expends on the problem. It's the maximum depth which is crucial unless the problem is trivial in which case who cares.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities are the adversary's fault. Vulnerabilities are the fault of the party that decided to ship the faulty product.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Work:</strong> A ""Vulnerability Engineer"" in the Java SE Security team for Oracle Corporation UK Ltd.</p>

<p><strong>Top advice:</strong> If I were you, I wouldn't be starting from here.</p>

<p><strong>Toast advice:</strong> Look after the corners and the middle will look after itself.</p>

<p>After an unfortunate journey taking him through the restricted lands of Pacal, Delphi, VB, Java, C++, C#, he finally discovered Ruby.

Going from not knowing Ruby to knowing Ruby was for him a revelation of roughly the same order of magnitude as discovering programming. He discovered Git at about the same time he started working with Ruby professionally, and had the same kind of revelation for source control.
</p><p>
Needless to say, both tools are now the underpinnings of most of the things he undertakes programmatically.

Mathieu can be observed in the wild, sometimes going under the name of webmat. He will often be rambling (programblings.com) about programming, Git or working on open source projects.

<p>Lately I've been coding an application and some tools that make use of AMQP messaging, in particular using RabbitMQ as the MQ Broker. I am very impressed at how AMQP, combined with network db APIs, lets you build an application in many small decoupled components that can easily be scaled on one or many servers.</p>

<p>Since RabbitMQ is implemented in Erlang, I learned enough Erlang to make a simple management app that runs on an independent Erlang node, i.e. not a RabbitMQ plugin. And since my company's main language is Java, I am now learning Scala (with Akka actors) since this JVM language has part of its heritage in Erlang.</p>

<p>Java by day, C++ by night, and sometimes my dreams are in ML for some reason.</p>

<p>But why should statically-typed languages have all the fun?</p>

<p>Once maintained a system that was a freakish maze of PHP, mod_perl, Bash, and LaTeX.  I only have myself to blame.  But, I learned from the experience and so my next project was a freakish maze of JSP, Perl, Bash, and Ruby.</p>

231316,Chris Haas,33728,"La Crosse, WI",2009-12-14,2016-11-26,http://www.cjhaas.com,"<p>Building a computer system is like building a Rube Goldberg machine: you have an expected outcome and you've got a collection of things that someone else made but how you put those together is completely up to you. Sure, there's constraints like gravity and friction, but the more you understand them the more you can use them to your advantage.</p>

<p>There's a great video by <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/clifford_stoll_on_everything"" rel=""nofollow"">Clifford Stoll</a> where he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first time you do something, it's science. The second time, it's engineering. A third time, it's just being a technician.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That simple outlook completely resonates with me because <strong>I'm a software engineer</strong>. I have no delusions that I'm a computer scientist inventing new things, I'm using tools made by other people - and I love it!</p>

<p>As an engineer, I also like to take things apart to learn how things work. If I don't know how something works then it is effectively magic as far as I'm concerned and I really don't want to use it.</p>

<p>On the extreme end of this, for some weird reason <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=votes&amp;q=user%3a231316%20%5bpdf%5d"">I know a lot about PDFs</a>. I actually even have a printed copy of the 1.6 PDF spec that I took on vacation to read. You know, for fun. What's weirdest of all is that I have almost no need of this knowledge in my day job, I just find the PDF language to be very well thought out. This has also lead me to be very knowledgeable in the PDF libraries iText and iTextSharp which, once again, I don't actually use in my day job.</p>

<p>But my passion is for languages and frameworks that allow me to express my ideas in a consistent manner. I grew up with BASIC and have learned probably a dozen variants of it over the years so I have a special place in my heart for VB.Net although most of my .Net work has been in C# lately. The languages are so close these days that I sometimes don't even notice which one I'm in!</p>

<p>Lately, however, PHP has been my language of choice. I don't think it is the best language out there and in fact I agree with many people's sentiments that it is <a href=""http://phpsadness.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">inconsistent, confusing and non-discoverable</a> but man can you do a lot with it!</p>

<p>I also really enjoy <strike>JavaScript</strike> ECMAScript but weirdly don't know jQuery or any other framework. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against jQuery, <a href=""http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">I just don't have a need for it</a>.</p>

<p>And please hear me out on this last one. <strong>I love WordPress</strong>. I've built dozens of custom content management solutions over the years and implemented many open source as well as very, very expensive proprietary ones and WordPress combines all of the best features of these. True, you generally have to write more code to customize WordPress than other CMSs out there, but I think that's a good thing! Everyone has their own specific content model and trying to create an interface that works for <em>everybody</em> just leads to impossible to use clutter.</p>

<p>I am MCSE+I which, while I have absolutely no desire to administer, goes a long way towards understanding the requirements, constraints and possible implication of the applications I design. This includes skilled installation, configuration and maintenance of IIS and SQL Server.</p>

<p>I have an keen eye for detail, strive for excellence but know when good enough is good enough. I move fast and clean and I can work in a team or as a one man hit squad.</p>

<p>I have also had extensive experience in the realm of the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/tags/asp.net-membership/stats"">ASP.Net Provider Stack</a>.</p>

<p>Currently my primary focus is on the Microsoft stack but 20 years of development and infrastructure experience  coupled with a driving need to know and an infallible knack for finding out makes me uniquely qualified to deliver solutions for a broad spectrum of problem domains.</p>
